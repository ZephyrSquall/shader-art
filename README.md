# Zephyr Squall's Shader Art

I have recently learned how to use GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) to create shader art, which I have
been using to produce animated backgrounds for some of my artwork. Ideally, I'd like people to be
able to take my code and run it locally on their computers. To make this as easy as possible, I aim
to set up a website that will automatically execute the shader code in the browser, so all a viewer
needs to do is follow a URL to this site.

This repository is my initial test of such a website. If all goes well, I plan to eventually expand
this repo into a gallery of my shader art.

This website is hosted on Fermyon Cloud. It can be accessed at
